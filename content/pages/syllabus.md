## Course Meeting Times

Seminars: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

## Prerequisites

Students must have completed [*14.01 Principles of Microeconomics*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/14-01-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2018/) before taking this course.

## Course Description

What is the relationship between infrastructure and economic growth and development? How does energy security affect geopolitical relations among nations as well as socioeconomic relations within nations? This seminar will cover some of these timely and complex questions linking infrastructure and energy and their technologies. We will examine efforts in economically developing and developed nations to build, finance, and regulate infrastructure systems, technologies, and services, particularly those affecting energy security. We will explore how infrastructure is defined, financed, and delivered; how infrastructure, technologies, and innovations are intertwined; how infrastructure supports the energy system and its technologies; and how different countries face the challenges of energy security. Students will think about how the current worldwide economic and energy crises can be an opportunity for making fundamental changes to improve collapsing infrastructure networks and technologies and to attain energy sustainability.

The final research paper, not exceeding 25 pages (double spaced) should be on a topic related to energy infrastructure. Students will present a summary of their papers during the last week of the term. Emphasis is on the quality of the writing.

## Academic Misconduct

Plagiarism and cheating are both academic crimes. Never (1) turn in an assignment that you did not write yourself. (2) turn in an assignment for this class that you previously turned in for another class, or (3) cheat on an exam. If you do so, it may result in a failing grade for the class, and possibly even suspension from the college. Anyone caught cheating in any way will be reported to the provost in line with recognized university procedures.
